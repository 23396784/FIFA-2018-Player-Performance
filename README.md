⚽ FIFA 2018 Player Performance & Positional Analytics

Comprehensive Data Exploration & Insights Using Python

This project presents a full analytical breakdown of 17,981 FIFA 2018 players, focusing on performance metrics, positional strengths, wage patterns, and future talent identification. The analysis provides rich insights into how football clubs evaluate players, the attributes that drive performance, and how positional profiles differ across the game.

The project answers key football analytics questions such as:

Which countries produce the most professional players?

At what age do players typically peak?

Which attacking position earns the highest wages — Striker, Right Winger, or Left Winger?

Who were the top 5 players per position in terms of overall and potential?

How do wages relate to player potential (especially ages 16–28)?

Do defenders display higher aggression than strikers?

How do Strikers vs Goalkeepers compare in acceleration, agility, ball control, balance, and aggression?

Which clubs have the highest share of English, Spanish, and German players?

Which clubs have the best future stars (Overall <86 and Potential ≥86)?

How do elite clubs pay their players (Barcelona, PSG, Real Madrid, Juventus, etc.)?
