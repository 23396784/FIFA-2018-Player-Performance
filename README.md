FIFA 2018 Player Performance &amp; Positional Analytics

This project explores detailed performance statistics of FIFA 2018 players to uncover meaningful insights that can inform team selection, talent scouting, and strategic decision-making. Using a structured dataset containing player attributes such as age, nationality, overall rating, potential, value, wage, and position-specific skills, the analysis evaluates how player characteristics relate to performance.

The goal is to help teams identify high-value players, understand positional strengths, and recognise the attributes most strongly associated with top performance.

🔍 Project Objectives

Analyse overall player performance trends across FIFA 2018.

Identify which skills contribute most to higher overall ratings.

Compare players across positions (e.g., forwards, midfielders, defenders, goalkeepers).

Examine age and potential progression to determine long-term talent value.

Highlight top-performing players and countries with the strongest squads.

📊 Key Insights (from analysis & dashboard)

Younger players with high potential outperform older players over time.

Wages and player value strongly correlate with overall rating.

Attacking players show higher volatility in performance than defensive players.

European countries dominate the list of top-rated footballers.

Physical attributes (such as stamina and strength) significantly influence overall performance in certain positions.
