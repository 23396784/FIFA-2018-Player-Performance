FIFA 2018 Player Performance &amp; Positional Analytics

This project explores player performance patterns using the FIFA 2018 dataset, transforming raw player attributes into meaningful insights through data cleaning, preprocessing, and statistical exploration.
It forms part of a broader portfolio demonstrating practical analytical skills in Python, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualisation.

🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to understand how different attributes—such as age, overall rating, potential, physical stats, contract duration, and player value—contribute to a player’s performance.

The project includes:

Cleaning and preparing the FIFA 2018 dataset

Handling missing values and data types

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualising trends such as:

Rating distribution

Age vs. performance

Player value vs. potential

Nationality-based trends

Extracting insights useful for scouting, strategy, and player development

🛠 Tools & Technology

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

PowerPoint (for presentation insights)

📊 Key Insights

Younger players generally show higher potential growth.

Market value strongly correlates with overall rating, but also varies by position.

Physical attributes (pace, strength, stamina) strongly influence the performance of forwards and midfielders.

🎯 Objective

To demonstrate end-to-end analytical capability—from raw data to actionable insights—using modern data science tools and visualisation techniques.
