FIFA 2018 Player Performance &amp; Positional Analytics

This project explores detailed performance statistics of FIFA 2018 players to uncover meaningful insights that can inform team selection, talent scouting, and strategic decision-making. Using a structured dataset containing player attributes such as age, nationality, overall rating, potential, value, wage, and position-specific skills, the analysis evaluates how player characteristics relate to performance.

The goal is to help teams identify high-value players, understand positional strengths, and recognise the attributes most strongly associated with top performance.
