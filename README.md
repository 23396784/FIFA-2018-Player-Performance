⚽ FIFA 2018 Player Performance & Positional Analytics

This project analysed the FIFA 2018 player dataset, featuring 17,000+ footballers across all major leagues. Using Python and Power BI, it explores player performance, wage patterns, positional differences, talent potential, and club-level composition. The analysis provides a data-driven understanding of how footballers differ based on age, position, nationality, and skill profiles — just as a real football manager would assess talent.
